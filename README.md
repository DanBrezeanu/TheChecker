# TheChecker
General purpose coding evaluator and checker.

* Users can create an account and solve different coding problems
* Results are checked against test cases of different size and difficulty
* Time is checked against a maximum time limit
* Adding problems is just as easy as creating a .yaml file and a couple of tests
* Official solution is available once a problem is marked with 100%

The live version is available [here](http://danbrezeanu.hopto.org/checker).
